You are building the Glowra Backend, the core engine powering a youth mental wellness companion platform.

Since Replit doesn’t support Docker/Cloud Run directly, adapt the plan as follows:

📌 Project Overview

Glowra is a journey-based mental wellness platform for students/youth that:

Entry point → Interactive AI chatbot/journaling (collects mood + context).

Guidance layer → Personalized recommendations (planner, resources, exercises).

Engagement layer → Gamification, community connect, mentor integration.

Tracking layer → Progress dashboard (analytics + reports).

Your responsibility is to implement the Backend/AI system using Flask on Replit with Google Cloud integrations.

🛠 Tech Stack (Backend/AI)

Framework: Flask (instead of FastAPI, due to Replit limitation).

Auth: Firebase Auth (for secure login/signup).

Database: Google Firestore (flexible for journaling + user progress).

AI Layer:

Vertex AI + Gemini → journaling sentiment, recommendations, chatbot.

Gemma (optional) → lightweight local inference if needed.

Analytics: BigQuery + Vertex AI dashboards.

Storage: Google Cloud Storage (for audio, meditation files).

📂 Backend Roadmap (Tasks for You)

Implement these modules one by one:

1. 🔑 Authentication

Integrate Firebase Auth into Flask routes.

Expose endpoints for /signup, /login, /logout.

Secure API routes using Firebase tokens.

2. 🧠 AI Journal + Chatbot

Endpoint: /journal (POST) → Accepts text input from user journaling.

Process:

Send text → Vertex AI (Gemini) for sentiment/emotion classification.

Generate supportive response + store both input & AI output in Firestore.

Endpoint: /chat (POST) → AI-powered guidance/therapy-style chatbot.

3. 📅 Planner & Resources

Endpoint: /planner → Return personalized action items (exercises, study tips, meditation tasks) from Firestore.

Allow journaling → trigger tailored daily planner update.

4. 🏆 Engagement Layer

Add gamification: streaks, points, badges API.

Store progress in Firestore.

Endpoint: /community → placeholder API for connecting to mentor/peer groups.

5. 📊 Analytics & Tracking

Store user journaling metadata in BigQuery for analytics.

Expose /progress → returns user stats (mood trends, streaks, tasks completed).

Future: Integrate Vertex AI Dashboards.

6. 🎧 Multimedia & Storage

Endpoint /meditations → fetch list of meditation audio files from Cloud Storage.

Endpoint /upload → support saving voice/text journaling.

📦 Implementation Notes

Use Flask’s Blueprints to organize routes (auth, journal, planner, progress).

Connect Google Cloud SDK → Firestore, BigQuery, Vertex AI, Storage.

Keep API modular for easy scaling to Cloud Run later.

Use requirements.txt:

flask
firebase-admin
google-cloud-firestore
google-cloud-bigquery
google-cloud-storage
google-cloud-aiplatform


Deploy/test fully in Replit first. Cloud deployment comes later.

✅ Deliverables in Replit

app.py (Flask entry point).

/routes folder → auth.py, journal.py, planner.py, progress.py.

requirements.txt with all dependencies.

config.py → Firebase + Google Cloud credentials.

Working APIs:

/signup, /login

/journal, /chat

/planner

/progress

/meditations

💡 Key instruction for Replit: Stick to Flask instead of FastAPI. Avoid Docker. Use Google Cloud libraries (Firestore, BigQuery, Vertex AI). Keep modular structure. Build endpoints incrementally.
